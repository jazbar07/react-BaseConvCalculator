<!-- About the Project -->
## About the Project

The project at its core is very simple- it's a base converter application built entirely in JavaScript that puts to use the React library. 

Said application allows its user to type a number into a given 'input' field, identify which base the user inputted number is (decimal, binary, hexadecimal, octal) from a drop-down menu of 4 pre-selected options, and press submit to see this number converted and displayed in all 4 number base forms.

The project itself was built primarily to try out the wildly popular ReactJS library, put to use the principle of modularity that is made so easy through ReactJs' use of components, try out props, and put to use soome user pre-made components, like react-select. Thoough the project has achieved it's main goal- conversion + trying out React- more will be added to it over time!
